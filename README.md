# Battleship
In your README reflect on the following:

Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you would’ve approached the design and problem solving process.
If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?
Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.
Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.
Presentation points:
[ ] Demonstration of functional completeness

Run your runner file, and demonstrate how the game is played in the terminal. If you’ve considered edge cases, make sure you demonstrate that functionality in your demo.
[ ] Technical quality and organization of the code

At a high level (not line by line), describe how you broke out this game. What classes did you create? What is the responsibility of each class? Why did you choose to design your code in this way?
Is there a design decision that you made that you’re particularly proud of?
[ ] Identifying code that should be refactored and how it would be refactored

Identify a piece of code that you’d like to refactor. How would you update that code?
Are there any parts of your code that you’re unsure/hesitant about? Why?
[ ] Discussion of test coverage

Show examples of a unit and an integration test that you wrote.
Run your test suite and open coverage report (if you were able to implement simplecov)
[ ] Discussion of Pairing/version control

How did you all work together? Did you use a particular pairing technique?
Walk us through your GitHub insights. How many pull requests did you make? How many commits did you make?
Can you identify a PR that was made that demonstrates good commenting/partner review workflow?
